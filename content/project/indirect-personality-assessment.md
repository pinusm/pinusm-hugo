Self-concept is the sum of a person’s knowledge about their individual qualities, personality traits, and behavioral patterns. It is complex and multi-faceted, and is traditionally assessed using self-report questionnaires. However, despite having high face-validity, self-report measures are prone to response biases, especially when measuring negative self-related information, such as self-criticism. In order to address some of these biases, researchers developed several indirect measures, commonly known as implicit measures. To date, measurement of the self-concept has mainly focused on implicit self-esteem. Drawing on the same logic that led to implicit assessment of self-esteem, and to the theoretical construct Implicit Self-Esteem, I propose a novel theoretical construct, namely, Implicit Self-Criticism.  

Self-criticism is an intense and persistent relationship with the self, characterized by (1) an uncompromising demand for high standards in performance; and (2) an expression of hostility and derogation towards the self when these high standards are — inevitably — not met. Explicit self-criticism, assessed with self-report questionnaires, is linked with mental disorders, clinical problems, and developmental difficulties. Implicit self-criticism could be conceptualized as the 'true' self-criticism, cleaned from self-presentation distortions, or, alternatively, as an independent psychological trait from explicit self-criticism. From the perspective that considers implicit constructs to be the automatic, sometimes unconscious, counterpart of explicit constructs, implicit self-criticism are automatic and uncontrolled self-critical thoughts (e.g., “you’re not good enough/you’re a disgrace”), systematically distorting cognitive content and process.  

In this research plan, I examine whether implicit self-criticism is a useful theoretical construct. I will do that by testing the reliability and validity of several indirect measures of self-criticism, developed for this research: Self-Criticism IAT, Self-Criticism Questionnaire-Based IAT, Self-Criticism Relational Responding Task, and Self-Critical Behavior. I will examine the relation between these measures and measures of theoretically relevant constructs (i.e., construct validity). I will search for evidence that these measures add knowledge by predicting relevant outcomes (i.e., criterion validity) better than the available direct measures of self-criticism (i.e., incremental validity).  

Studies will adopt cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, in an online and laboratory setting, and will sample both normative students and out-patients. Sample size will be 120-600, varied by study. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses will be employed.
